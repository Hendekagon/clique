# Clique

Some code for generating function dependency graphs

## Usage




Clique goes through your source code to find which functions depend on which other functions.
If you analyze the dependency graph, you can find for example which functions are most used
by other functions (in-degree - in the Clojure core namespace these are: concat, seq and list),
or which functions are most dependent on other functions.
